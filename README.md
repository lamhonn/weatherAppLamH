# Weather App Demo Project
## Made by Honn Lam

This is a demo project involving usage of an outer API, which in this case is **OpenWeather API**.

This app shows current weather and a forecast for next five days in three hour intervals for a searched location.

Before running the app, create a ```.env``` file and include your OpenWeather API key in ```REACT_APP_API_KEY```. 

To run this app, clone this repository, and then:
```
cd [repositery name]
yarn install
yarn start
```
